## Including addin
Including addin in cake script is easy.

```
## Usage

Dart has to be installed and it's dart.exe in path.

To use the addin add it to Cake call the aliases and configure any settings you want.

```csharp
#addin "Cake.Dart"
...

// Runs dart agains some.dart file using --pause-isolates-on-exit setting
Task("Dart")
	.Does(() => {
		// or more containers at once
		DartScript(File("some.dart"), new DartSettings{ PauseIsolatesOnExit = true });
	)};
```
Other commands follow same convention.

This version is built against Dart compiler 2.1.0.
